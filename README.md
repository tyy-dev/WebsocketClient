# WebsocketClient
Websocket client for socket.io or normal connections

Examples projects that use my Websocket client lib
* https://github.com/tyy-dev/PCWebsocketExampleClient, connects to [pokemonchess.com](https://pokemonchess.com/) attempts to join the frst available room if it exists.
* Another project would be https://github.com/tyy-dev/agarioclone-socketio-clien however it is quite undocumented and might be less of a straightforward example.
